## eth\_estimateGas

Generates and returns an estimate of how much gas is necessary to allow the transaction to complete. The transaction will not be added to the blockchain.

## eth\_feeHistory

Returns base fee per gas and transaction effective priority fee per gas history for the requested block range, allowing you to track trends over time.

As of EIP-4844, this method tracks transaction blob gas fees as well.

### Parameters

* blockCount: QUANTITY - number of blocks in the requested range. Between 1 and 1024 blocks can be requested in a single query. If blocks in the specified block range are not available, then only the fee history for available blocks is returned. Accepts hexadecimal or integer values.

* rewardPercentiles: QUANTITY - (optional) A monotonically increasing list of decimal percentile values to sample from each block's effective priority fees per gas in ascending order, weighted by gas used.

### Returns

* Object - fee history results object.

Object - A fee history object:

* oldestBlock: QUANTITY - lowest number block of the returned range.
* baseFeePerGas: Array - array of block base fees per gas, including an extra block value. The extra value is the next block after the newest block in the returned range. Returns zeroes for blocks created before EIP-1559.

* reward: Array - array of effective priority fee per gas data points from a single block. All zeroes are returned if the block is empty.

## eth\_getBlockReceipts

Returns all transaction receipts for a given block. Transaction receipts provide a way to track the success or failure of a transaction (1 if successful and 0 if failed), as well as the amount of gas used and any event logs that might have been produced by a smart contract during the transaction.

### Parameters

* QUANTITY|TAG - integer of a block number, or the string "latest"

### Returns

* Array of transaction receipt objects - A transaction receipt objects array, or null when no receipt was found.

Object - A transaction receipt object:

* cumulativeGasUsed : QUANTITY - The total amount of gas used when this transaction was executed in the block.
* logsBloom: DATA, 256 Bytes - Bloom filter for light clients to quickly retrieve related logs.
* logs: Array - Array of log objects, which this transaction generated.
* transactionHash : DATA, 32 Bytes - hash of the transaction.
* transactionIndex: QUANTITY - integer of the transactions index position in the block.
* blockHash: DATA, 32 Bytes - hash of the block where this transaction was in.
* blockNumber: QUANTITY - block number where this transaction was in.
* gasUsed : QUANTITY - The amount of gas used by this specific transaction alone.
* contractAddress : DATA, 20 Bytes - The contract address created, if the transaction was a contract creation, otherwise null.
* from: DATA, 20 Bytes - address of the sender.
* to: DATA, 20 Bytes - address of the receiver. null when its a contract creation transaction.
* type: QUANTITY - transaction type.

It also returns either :

* root : DATA 32 bytes - post-transaction stateroot (pre Byzantium)
* status: QUANTITY - either 1 (success) or 0 (failure)

### Example

```bash
curl https://rpc-endpoint.io:8545 -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockReceipts","params":["latest"],"id":1}'

## eth\_getFilterLogs

Returns an array of all logs matching filter with given id.

### Returns

Array - Array of log objects, or an empty array

* For filters created with eth\_newFilter logs are objects with the following params:
  * logIndex: QUANTITY - integer of the log index position in the block. null when its pending log.
  * removed: TAG - true when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization. false if its a valid log.

## eth\_getLogs

Returns an array of all logs matching a given filter object.

### Parameters

Object - The filter options:

* fromBlock: QUANTITY|TAG - (optional, default: "latest") Integer block number, or "latest" for the last mined block
* toBlock: QUANTITY|TAG - (optional, default: "latest") Integer block number, or "latest" for the last mined block
* address: DATA|Array, 20 Bytes - (optional) Contract address or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.
* topics: Array of DATA - (optional) Array of 32 Bytes DATA topics. Topics are order-dependent. Each topic can also be an array of DATA with “or” options.
* blockhash: DATA, 32 Bytes - (optional) With the addition of EIP-234, blockHash will be a new filter option which restricts the logs returned to the single block with the 32-byte hash blockHash. Using blockHash is equivalent to fromBlock = toBlock = the block number with hash blockHash. If blockHash is present in the filter criteria, then neither fromBlock nor toBlock is allowed.

### Returns

* Array of log objects - log objects matching the filter criteria.

Object - A log object:

* address: DATA, 20 Bytes - address the log originated from.
* topics: Array of DATA, 32 bytes each - event signature hash and 0 to 4 indexed log arguments.
* data: DATA, 20 bytes each - non-indexed arguments of the log.
* blockNumber: QUANTITY - number of the block that includes the log. null when log is pending.
* transactionHash: DATA, 32 Bytes - hash of the starting transaction for the log. null when log is pending.
* transactionIndex: QUANTITY - index position of the starting transaction for the log. null when log is pending.
* blockHash: DATA, 32 Bytes - hash of the block that includes the log. null when log is pending.
* logIndex: QUANTITY - log index position in the block. null when log is pending.
* removed: TAG - true if log removed due to chain reorganization, otherwise false.

### Example

```bash
curl https://rpc-endpoint.io:8545 -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getLogs","params":[{"topics": ["0x000000000000000000000000a94f5374fce5edbc8e2a8697c15331677e6ebf0b"]}],"id":1}'
